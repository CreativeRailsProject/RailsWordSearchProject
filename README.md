# Project Summary

Using our project, users will be able to create a fun, easy, and unique word search. The word search will be filled with words specified 

by the user themselves, taking up to ten words that are less than 11 characters long. Once the user is satisfied with their selection of words,

they can hit the 'Generate!' button to receive the fully generated word search in their browser. The word search will mix the words in with random 

letters, with all of the words arranged horizontally left-to-right. The user will also be able to see a word bank below the word search, complete with

all of the words they originally input into the generator.

# Users

Any person looking to create a fun activity to share with others. This could be teachers making assignments for their students, 

friends creating a game to share with their friends, or a bored individual looking to entertain themselves.
